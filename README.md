## Comments
Professor Downing told us we could fix our merging issue late without any late points. We added our Technical Report and README to master instead of development which caused our merge later to fail. Our development branch will show these two files as the only ones edited after the original due date, but as proof that we did them on time you can view their commits here: https://gitlab.com/urielkugelmass/relievepoverty/commit/b820510063ee1469a1a7c3f417547e968c3a1680# and https://gitlab.com/urielkugelmass/relievepoverty/commit/239bd4abfd06fd56cc6957f3f2688290add93b73
Additionally, our pipelines failed today when trying to fix the above issue because we had a test that queried data from the last 30 days. Since the amount expected was different from yesterday (31 days ago) the test failed so we needed to edit it after the deadline.
